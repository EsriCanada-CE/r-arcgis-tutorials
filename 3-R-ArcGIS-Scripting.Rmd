# Tutorial Overview

R is an open-source statistical computing language that offers a large
suite of data analysis and statistical tools, and is currently the de
facto standard for statistical data analysis and visualization for
academics and other communities. While its various third-party packages
introduce a variety of advanced spatial statistical capabilities, it can
be a challenge to access many spatial datasets. The **R-ArcGIS** bridge
solves this challenge by providing an `arcgisbinding` package that
allows ArcGIS datasets to be read and written easily from the R
programming language. This tutorial will introduce you to the use of the
R-ArcGIS Bridge in R scripts, and enable you to integrate ArcGIS
datasets into your R statistical processes. It will also give you the
pre-requisite knowledge to create script tools in ArcGIS that execute R
functions, which will be covered in the following tutorial in this
series.

## Background Information

The R user community has seen substantial growth in recent years, and is
expected to continue growing due to the increasing popularity of
statistical data analysis. You can use R in conjunction with ArcGIS to
develop tools that can broaden the functionality of ArcGIS. Before you
can create these tools, you need to develop an understanding of how to
work with the `arcgisbinding` package that is installed by the
**R-ArcGIS** bridge. Learning how to incorporate ArcGIS datasets into
your R scripts to perform data analysis will greatly extend the
possibilities that exist for analyzing both spatial and non-spatial
data.

R is different from many other programming languages, in that it was
developed primarily for data analysis and computational statistics.
While the language and environment have evolved over the past two
decades to incorporate many other capabilities, this initial focus
provides R with almost every statistical model and data manipulation
technique that you would need for modern data analysis. However, it can
be a challenge to integrate with other data types or software
environments.

The `arcgisbinding` package resolves the challenge of working with
ArcGIS datasets by introducing to R a set of functions and classes that
facilitate reading, writing, and manipulating ArcGIS datasets in the R
programming language. It further enables integration of R with ArcGIS
software through the ability to create script tools in ArcGIS toolboxes
that execute R code.

By completing this tutorial, you will become familiar with the use of
the `arcgisbinding` and the capabilities it introduces to the R
environment. You will learn how to read and write data from ArcGIS
datasets, and manipulate and analyze spatial data in the R programming
language.

# Part A: Getting Started

To prepare for this workshop, you should have successfully completed the
*Getting Started* and *R Scripting Basics* tutorials, which will ensure
that you the required software installed and configured, as well as the
basic R scripting skills necessary to complete this tutorial. From the
*R Scripting Basics* tutorial, should be familiar with the **R** and
**RStudio** software, and be able to work with the R Markdown format
within the **RStudio** IDE. In this tutorial, everything discussed can
be completed using the default **RGui** installed with **R**. However,
this document is available as an R-Markdown file that you can open and
use interactively in **RStudio**. If you choose instead to use **RGui**
or another IDE, you can copy/paste code snippets into any R console or R
script, or otherwise or adapt the code in another IDE environment.

## Setup

To work with the R Markdown source for this document:

1.  Open the *`r-arcgis-rstudio.Rproj`* file in **RStudio**
2.  Open the *File* tab in the top-right panel (based on the layout
    options recommended in the *R Scripting Basics* tutorial), and click
    on the file named *`3-R-ArcGIS-Scripting.Rmd`*. The R-Markdown
    source code for this document will open in the *Source* editor
    window in the top-left.
3.  In the top-right corner of the source editor, you may click the
    ![](images/rstudio-maxpane.jpg) maximize icon to toggle the
    maximized state of the panel, and use as much screen space as
    possible to display the document's source code.

***Note:*** The remainder of this document is written with the
expectation that you are working with the R Markdown file in
**RStudio**. If not, you may manually copy R commands enclosed in the
\`\`\`{r} code blocks into any R console, provided that your current
working directory (reported by `getwd()`) corresponds with the location
where the tutorial files are located.

Before proceeding to interactively run code in the rest of the R
Markdown document, select *Restart R and Clear Output* from the
![Run](images/rstudio-runmenu.jpg) menu, and then run the following
block to configure the R environment to help with the display of outputs
in the resulting R Notebook, and to prepare a `example.gdb` file
geodatabase from an empty template in the `data/` folder:

```{r}
# Run this line to disable magic quotes in output...
options(useFancyQuotes = FALSE)

# If a copy of example.gdb exists, delete it...
if (file.exists('data/example.gdb')) {
  unlink('data/example.gdb', recursive = TRUE)
}

# Create a new folder named 'example.gdb' and copy the contents of 'empty.gdb' into it:
if (!file.exists('data/example.gdb')) {
  dir.create('data/example.gdb')
  invisible(file.copy(paste0('data/empty.gdb/',list.files('data/empty.gdb')), 'data/example.gdb', overwrite = TRUE, recursive = FALSE, copy.mode = TRUE))
}
```

## Load the R-ArcGIS `arcgisbinding` package

In any stand-alone R script, you must load the `arcgisbinding` package
in the current R session, and then call `arc.check_product()` before you
can use any of the functionality provided by the `arcgisbinding`
package. In the next tutorial, you will learn that this is not required
when using an R script configured as a script tool in an ArcGIS Toolbox.
However, it is a step that must always be performed to use
`arcgisbinding` methods from an R console or in an R IDE such as
**RStudio**.

To get started using the `arcgisbinding` package in this tutorial, run
the block of code below to load the package and bind to your **ArcGIS
Pro** or **ArcGIS Desktop** (ArcMap) software in your current R session:

```{r}
library(arcgisbinding)
arc.check_product()
```

*Hint: Remember from the* R Scripting Basics\* tutorial that the
`helper-functions.R` script included in the tutorial files provides
methods that do this for you. You can try replacing the lines above with
the R command to `source()` the helper script, and then use the
`load_pkgs()` function. You could also replace any `library()`
statements in the remainder of this document with `load_pkgs()`, which
would ensure any missing CRAN packages are be installed automatically
from the Internet.\*

# Part B: Reading data from ArcGIS Datasets

The `arcgisbinding` package provides two methods that enable you to
easily read data directly from ArcGIS datasets. For reading data, you
will use `arc.open()` to create dataset objects that essentially serve
as a connection to an existing ArcGIS dataset. With a dataset object,
you may then use `arc.select()` to connect to existing datasets and read
features/tables into data frames in the R workspace, or `arc.raster()`
to load raster datasets.

## Connecting to an ArcGIS dataset

To use the `arc.open()` method to connect to an existing ArcGIS dataset,
you must provide it with a single argument that specifies a path. The
path must point to a standard feature class, feature layer, table, or
raster dataset in a format supported by ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop.
These include simple files (e.g., shapefiles, csv, dBASE), geodatabases
(file/enterprise), feature dataset components, GeoTiff images, etc. In
64-bit/Pro, feature service URLs will also work.

The returned result from the `arc.open()` method is a dataset object,
which contains details about the spatial characteristics and attributes
contained within the dataset.

***Note:** When specifying paths, be sure to escape backslashes (using
double-backslashes), or use forward slashes. Paths may be absolute paths
(starting with a drive letter (e.g., `C:/`), or a network share
(`//hostname/share/`)), or they can be relative to the current working
directory (that you can get or set the with `getwd()` and `setwd()`
commands)*

Start by opening the polygon boundaries for census subdivisions from
Statistics Canada for the 2016 Census:

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.open
csd <- arc.open("data/census/census2016.gdb/CensusSubdivisions")
```

You can report a summary of the dataset, or inspect several attributes
as object properties (path, dataset_type, extent, fields, and
spatialinfo) using the `@` operator:

```{r}
csd
csd@shapeinfo
csd@extent
```

## Reading an ArcGIS dataset into a data frame

To load data from the connection into a data frame in the current R
session, use the `arc.select()` method. This method requires a dataset
object created by the `arc.open()` as its first argument. You may also
optionally supply any of the four following as positional or named
arguments:

-   `fields` - A character vector of one or more fieldnames to select.
    Defaults to `'*'` (i.e., to select all fields)
-   `where_clause` - An optional string representing an SQL query to
    filter features read from the dataset. Defaults to an empty string
    (i.e., to select all records)
-   `selected` - In the context of a script tool, if records are
    selected in the layer or table from the corresponding ArcGIS Pro or
    ArcGIS Desktop session, then only those records will be read into
    the R session. Defaults to `TRUE`.
-   `sr` - If set to a well-known ID, well-known text, or Proj.4 text
    representation of a spatial reference, features will be
    automatically reprojected as they are read into the R session.
    Defaults to NULL (i.e., features will be read in their original
    spatial reference)

Load the CSD boundaries for Canada, and keep only the province name, CSD
name, and CSD Identifier attributes:

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.select
csd_df <- arc.select(csd, c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"))
```

The same data could be read with by providing the desired fieldnames as
a named argument to the `arc.select()`:

```{r}
csd_df <- arc.select(csd, fields = c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"))
class(csd_df)
```

***Tip:** using named arguments allows you to execute the function
without memorizing the positional order of optional arguments, and/or
omit optional that you do not want to define. Also note the use of the
`=` operator for named arguments, versus the `<-` assignment operator.*

# Part C: Working with ArcGIS datasets in R

Once you have loaded data from an ArcGIS dataset into an R session, you
can work with it like any regular data frame. For example, you may want
to load join some additional tabular data and join it to boundaries to
enable you to perform spatial analyses using a variety of spatial
statistical packages in R. Do do this, you could load a feature layer
that already has data joined to it from an ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop
session, or by reading data from feature layer that has a pre-defined
join in it.

## Manipulating ArcGIS spatial data frames

It is also possible to join two datasets easily within the R language
using functionality provided by the `dplyr` package. In the code block
below, income data from the 2016 census aggregated at the census
subdivision level are loaded from an ArcGIS file geodatabase table. An
SQL clause is applied to limit features to those with valid global
non-response rates below 25%, and the results are joined to the `csd_df`
data frame containing the census subdivision boundaries. The
forward-pipe operator `%>%` is used to chain the `arc.open()`,
`arc.select()` and `right_join()` methods in a single command, with the
result assigned to the `csd_income` variable:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Load income data for dissemination areas, and join by the csd geo_code the boundary data frame:
csd_income <- arc.open('data/census/census2016.gdb/income2016csd') %>% 
  arc.select(c("geo_code", "gnr", "pop2016_t", "popdens_t", "income_median_t"), where_clause = "gnr is not null and gnr < 25") %>% 
  right_join(csd_df, by = c("geo_code" = "CSDUID"))
class(csd_income)
```

This join operation produces a new data frame that does not include the
spatial information from the original `csd_df` data frame. To attach the
joined attributes back to the `csd_df` data frame, we can assign columns
directly. This can be done because the `csd_df` data frame was provided
as the 'right' data frame in the `right_join()` method above, so the
resulting `csd_income` data frame has the same number and order of rows:

```{r}
# Add columns back to the boundaries data frame:
csd_df$income_median_t <- csd_income$income_median_t
csd_df$pop2016_t <- csd_income$pop2016_t
csd_df$popdens_t <- csd_income$popdens_t
csd_df$gnr <- csd_income$gnr
```

***Note:** This limitation may be addressed in a future version of the
R-ArcGIS bridge. For the time being, this workaround is needed. Another
alternative, by converting the ArcGIS spatial data frame to an `sp` data
frame, and using the `spdplyr` package is discussed later in this
tutorial.*

It can be useful to rank or categorize data. For example, we can
categorize CSDs into quantiles using the `dplyr` `ntile()` method. There
are several other `dplyr` methods available for ranking data. Type
`?ranking` in the R console to read more - try adding a percentile rank
of CSDs by population density, for example:

```{r}
csd_df$income_group <- ntile(csd_df$income_median_t, 5)
```

With a quantile column now added, we can summarize data by groups. In
the code block below, the `csd_df` data frame is filtered to limit
operations to rows with a valid `income_group` value, then grouped by
`income_group`. Next, the `summarize_at()` function is used to obtain
min/max values of population and median income for each group. The
`mutate()` function created new columns with simpler names for the
results of the `summarize_at()` method. Using the `right_join()` and
`select()` methods, these new columns are joined to the `csd_df` data
frame, and then isolated from the rest of the columns in the data. The
results are assigned to a `csd_group_ranges` variable. To attach new
columns representing the min/max population and median income of each
census boundary's corresponding income group, we can assign columns from
the `csd_group_ranges` back to the original `csd_df` data frame:

```{r}
csd_group_ranges <- csd_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(income_group)) %>% 
  group_by(income_group) %>%
  summarize_at(
  vars(pop2016_t, income_median_t),list(min = ~min(., na.rm = TRUE),max = ~max(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  mutate(
    income_min = income_median_t_min,
    income_max = income_median_t_max,
    pop_min = pop2016_t_min,
    pop_max = pop2016_t_max
  ) %>%
  right_join(csd_df) %>% 
  join_by(income_min, income_max, pop_min, pop_max)

csd_df$income_min = csd_group_ranges$income_min
csd_df$income_max = csd_group_ranges$income_max
csd_df$pop_min = csd_group_ranges$pop_min
csd_df$pop_max = csd_group_ranges$pop_max
```

## Working with spatial data in R

Thus far we have learned how to work with ArcGIS spatial data frames,
which can be analyzed and manipulated much like any other data frame
objects in R. However, many packages in R that work with spatial data
require geospatial features to be represented in other object types. The
`arcgisbinding` package provides several methods that allow you to
convert data to/from `sf` types of data objects:

### Manipulation and visualization of spatial data

-   `arc.data2sp()` - easily converts ArcGIS spatial data frames to `sp`
    data frame objects (`SpatialPointsDataFrame`,
    `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, or `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`)
-   `arc.data2sf()` - converts ArcGIS spatial data frames to `sf` simple
    feature data frames (`POINT`, `MULTIPOINT`, `POLYGON`,
    `MULTIPOLYGON`, `LINESTRING`, or `MULTILINESTRING`)
-   `arc.shape2sp()` and `arc.shape2sf()` - if you do not require the
    attributes associated with your features, these methods may be used
    to convert an ArcGIS shape object (from an ArcGIS spatial data
    frame) into simple `sp` spatial objects (`SpatialLines`,
    `SpatialPoints`, or `SpatailPolygons`) or `sf` objects (`POINT`,
    `MULTIPOINT`, `POLYGON`, `MULTIPOLYGON`, `LINESTRING`, or
    `MULTILINESTRING`)

By converting your ArcGIS data frame objects to sf spatial data frames,
you can leverage a wide range of modern packages and operations in R
designed for spatial data analysis and visualization. The sf package
offers powerful and intuitive functions for spatial operations, such as
`st_union`, `st_intersection`, and `st_distance`, and integrates
seamlessly with the `dplyr` package for data manipulation. Additionally,
visualization is straightforward with the `ggplot2` package, which
supports spatial data through the `geom_sf()` function, allowing you to
create high-quality, customizable maps.

In the block of code below, the `csd_df` data frame with census
subdivision boundaries is converted into an sf object, which is assigned
to the `csd_sf` variable. Using dplyr’s `filter()` function to subset
the data and `ggplot2` for visualization, we generate a map displaying
the median income levels for census subdivisions in New Brunswick or
British Columbia. This workflow demonstrates the flexibility and power
of modern R packages for handling and visualizing spatial data.

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.data2sf

library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

# Convert ArcGIS data to an `sf` object
csd_sf <- arc.data2sf(csd_df)

# Filter for New Brunswick CSDs
csd_nb <- csd_sf %>%
  filter(grepl("New Brunswick", PRNAME))

# Show the income for CSDs in New Brunwswick::
ggplot(csd_nb) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = income_median_t)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Median Income in New Brunswick",
       fill = "Median Income")

# Filter for British Columbia
csd_bc <- csd_sf %>%
  filter(grepl("British Columbi", PRNAME))

# Show the income for CSDs in British Columbia:
ggplot(csd_bc) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = income_median_t)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Median Income in British Columbia",
       fill = "Median Income")
```

With the `sf` package available for working with spatial data frames, we
can perform additional operations like `left_join()` or `inner_join()`
and retain the data frame's spatial properties. For example, the earlier
code block that created the `csd_income` data frame by performing a join
with the `csd_df` data frame can be rewritten as follows:

```{r}
# Load Saskatchewan boundaries and income data:
sask_df <- arc.select(csd, fields = c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"), where_clause = "PRNAME like 'Sask%'")
income_df <- arc.open('data/census/census2016.gdb/income2016csd')  %>% 
        arc.select(c("geo_code", "gnr", "pop2016_t", "popdens_t", "income_median_t"), where_clause = "gnr is not null and gnr < 25")

# Join income data to the saskatchewan boundaries using by using an intermediate sf data frame 
csd_income_sf <- left_join(arc.data2sf(sask_df), income_df, by = c("CSDUID" = "geo_code"))

class(csd_income_sf)
```

The resulting `csd_income_sf` data frame created above will have ArcGIS
spatial properties, plus the additional columns added directly to it
from the joined data frame. If you inspect it in the *Environment* tab
in **RStudio**, you will see its first 7 columns are identical to the
`csd_df` that we have been working with so far in this tutorial.

### Analyzing spatial data in R

There are many different spatial statistical analysis packages available
for R. To get a thorough overview, refer to the Spatial CRAN Task View
at <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html>. Typically, the
spatial analysis functions in each of package will work with specific
structures of data, or specific data object types, such as `sf` data
frames.

As an example, using the income data available for census subdivisions,
we can calculate income inequality statistics using functions provided
by the `ineq` package. In the code block below, we can generate a Lorenz
curve and calculate the Gini coefficient for census subdivisions within
Ontario to measure inequality of median income across the province.

***Note:** the `plot()` and `text()` command must be executed at the
same time to work properly. When running these functions within the
R-Markdown document in **RStudio**, either highlight all of the lines
from the `plot()` command to the `text()` command and press*
**CTRL+Enter***, or run the entire block at once by pressing the ![Run
Chunk](images/rstudio-runchunk.jpg) button*

```{r eval=c(-8,-13)}
# Load the ineq package:
library(ineq)

# Filter out N/A values for income, and limit to Ontario CSDs:
on_spdata <- csd_sf %>% filter(!is.na(income_median_t), grepl("Ontario", PRNAME))

# Calculate the lorenz curve:
?Lc
lc <- Lc(on_spdata$income_median_t)
plot(lc)

# Calculate the Gini coefficient, and add it to the plot:
?Gini
g <- Gini(on_spdata$income_median_t)
text(0.2,0.9,paste(c("Gini: ", as.character(g)), collapse=""))
```

***Note:** this analysis is for illustrative purposes only - income
indicators aggregated at census subdivision levels will not reveal much
of the inequality that occurs within the census subdivisions themselves*

Since we have we have census subdivision boundaries associated with our
data, we can look at spatial properties of the Gini coefficient using
the `spGini()` method from the `lctools` package. The `spGini()`
function allows us to discern how much of the Gini coefficient we
observed for median income at the census subdivision level can be
attributed to a inequality among local neighbours (`gwGini` in the
output) vs non-spatial neighbours (`nsGini`). In this case, the
`spGini()` function requires simple coordinates represented as a matrix.
We can obtain the this from the centroid points of each census
subdivision using the `sp` package's `coordinates()` function.

```{r eval=c(-3,-4)}
library(lctools)

?spGini

# Extract centroids for polygon geometries
coords <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(on_spdata))

# You can now use these coordinates and the income data to calculate the Gini index
spG <- spGini(coords, 15, on_spdata$income_median_t)

# Display the Gini index result
spG
```

The results of the `spGini()` analysis in this example will show that
the majority of the Gini coefficient for the province of Ontario at the
census subdivision level does not come from inequality between
neighbouring locations (with 97.5% of the global Gini coming from
inequality between non-spatially coincident census subdivisions). The
significance of these results can be tested by running a monte-carlo
simulation series using the `mc.spGini()` function (***Note:** this test
may take a few minutes to execute*):

```{r eval=-1}
?mc.spGini

# Run a monte-carlo simulation to test significance:
spG.sim20 <- mc.spGini(Nsim=19, 15, on_spdata$income_median_t, coords[,1], coords[,2])
spG.sim20$pseudo.p
```

By running 19 (or more) simulations, it can be determined whether the
observed results from `spGini()` are significant by obtaining pseudo
p-value of 0.05 or lower (i.e., suggesting that the probability that the
observed result is due to chance is 5% or less).

# Part D: Writing data from R to ArcGIS datasets

At this point, we have shown that ArcGIS datasets can be read easily
into an R session, and demonstrated how you can manipulate spatial data
frames, visualize the spatial data in map plots, and use the spatial
data objects in spatial analyses. However, the **R-ArcGIS** bridge works
in both directions, enabling you to further analyze, visualize, and
collaborate by connecting the outputs of your R programs to the ArcGIS
platform.

The simplest approach for this that the `arcgisbinding` package provides
is to write your data to ArcGIS datasets using the `arc.write()` method.
With this function, you can write spatial and tabular data frames, and
raster objects to conventional ArcGIS dataset formats. The `arc.write()`
method requires at least two arguments:

-   `path`: the full or relative path to an ArcGIS dataset that will be
    created (e.g., \*.shp, \*.csv, \*.dbf, \*.gdb
    featureclass/table/raster, \*.img, \*.tif, etc.).
-   `data`: the data frame to be written (ArcGIS or `sp` spatial data
    frame, or simple tabular data frame). This must be an ArcGIS spatial
    data frame, an `sp` data frame, an `sf` object, a simple tabular
    data frame, or a `RasterLayer` or `RasterBrick` object from the
    `raster` package.

If you are using the `arc.write()` method from to overwrite an output
dataset, you can provide an additional `overwrite = TRUE` parameter to
the arguments. This will delete any existing dataset at the output path,
and replace it with the new one that you are writing.

***Note:** When writing output datasets, you will not see any error or
confirmation prompt if a dataset at the specified path already exists
when you provide the `overwrite = TRUE` option.*

In the code block below, you can see the Ontario census subdivision data
we analyzed as an `sp` spatial dataframe being written as a new feature
class in an a sample `example.gdb` file geodatabase:

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.write

arc.write('data/example.gdb/ontario_data', on_spdata, overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Choosing an output path for `arc.write()`:

When you specify the output path to use with `arc.write()`, ensure that
you appropriately define a new path for a shapefile inside a regular
folder, or to a new featureclass inside of an ArcGIS geodatabase. These
paths may be relative, or absolute file locations (as with the
`arc.open()` command), for example:

-   `arc.write('example.gdb/ontario_data', on_spdata)` - creates a new
    feature class in an existing `example.gdb` file geodatabase
-   `arc.write('data.sde/ontario_data', on_spdata)` - creates a new
    feature class in an existing enterprise geodatabse, identified by
    the `data.sde` connection file
-   `arc.write('data/ontario_data.shp' on_spdata)` - creates a new
    shapefile in the `data` folder location

If you want to save tabular data, specify path to a new table name in a
geodatabase, or an appropriate tabular file format in a folder. If you
only want to save tabular data from a spatial data frame object (whether
it is an `arcgisbinding`, `sp`, or `sf` data object), you can wrap the
variable in the `data.frame()` function to discard the spatial
information. For example:

-   `arc.write('example.gdb/ontario_data_tbl', data.frame(on_spdata))` -
    creates a new table in an existing `example.gdb` file geodatabase
-   `arc.write('data/ontario_data_tbl.dbf', data.frame(on_spdata)` -
    creates a new table in dBASE format in the `data` folder
-   `arc.write('data/ontario_data_tbl.csv' data.frame(on_spdata))` -
    creates a new table in comma-separated variable text format in the
    `data` folder

***Note:** fieldnames in feature classes and tables will be truncated
when written to shapefile or dBASE formats. When written to
geodatabases, invalid characters in fieldnames will be converted to
underscores, and fieldnames may otherwise be converted to upper or
lowercase depending on the underlying database system.*

If you are writing raster data objects, then you must similarly specify
a path to a new dataset name in a geodatabase, or to an appropriate
raster file format in a folder:

-   `arc.write('example.gdb/raster_dataset', raster_data)` - creates a
    new raster dataset in an existing `example.gdb` file geodatabase
-   `arc.write('data/raster_dataset.tif', raster_data)` - creates a
    GeoTiff file in the `data` folder

When an R script is run as a script tool in an ArcGIS Toolbox,
overwriting output files is less of a concern when the paths are defined
using output parameters. In this context, the ArcGIS geoprocessing
environment will either prevent overwriting existing datasets, or
cleanly remove them before executing the script tool (based on whether
the geoprocessing option to allow tools to overwrite outputs is
enabled). In this context, it should not be required to use the
`overwrite` parameter.

## Working with spatial reference definitions:

In some cases, depending on your specific data source and/or the process
through which your data are created, you may need to use different
representations of spatial reference systems. The `arcgisbinding`
package provides two convenience methods for converting between
Well-known ID / Well-known Text and Proj.4 spatial reference systems
definitions:

-   `arc.fromWktToP4()` - converts a Well-known ID (a.k.a., SRID) or
    Well-known Text spatial reference to Proj.4 text
-   `arc.fromP4ToWkt()` - converts a Proj.4 spatial reference text
    string to Well-known text format.

For example, to convert the standard web mercator projection from a its
well-known ID to Proj.4 text, then back to a full WKT text string:

```{r}
wm_p4 <- arc.fromWktToP4(3857)
wm_p4

wm_wkt <- arc.fromP4ToWkt(wm_p4)
wm_wkt
```

# Exercise 1

At this point, you are now able to read, manipulate, analyze, visualize,
and write ArcGIS datasets in the R programming language using the
`arcgisbinding` package installed by the **R-ArcGIS** bridge. To test
your skills, try the following:

-   Load the `data/toronto/neighbourhoods_crime.shp` shapefile into a
    new spatial data frame
-   Load the `data/toronto/wb_civics_2011.csv` table into a new data
    frame, and join its columns to the neighbourhoods_crime data frame.
    *Hint: one of these stores its identifier as a character vector*
-   Add a column with quantile ranks, group/summarize some of the data,
    create some box plots.
-   Write the data with the columns added from the wb_civics_2011.csv
    data back to a new shapefile. *Hint: remember the result of a join
    using dplyr with an ArcGIS spatial data frame does not return shape
    data – copy columns back to the original data frame created by the
    arc.select() command, or convert the data to an `sp` spatial data
    frame, then use the join commands provided by the `spdplyr`
    package.*
-   Add the new shapefile to your map in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap, and style
    it by the quantile ranks you added.

# Future Considerations

The `arcgisbinding` package provided by the **R-ArcGIS** bridge is an
effective tool to integrate ArcGIS datasets efficiently into your R
programs. It also allows you to generate new ArcGIS datasets as outputs
from your R programs to make results from your analyses easily viewed
and processed in ArcGIS applications. This is a significant advantage
for developing R programs that need to work with spatial datasets that
are easily managed by ArcGIS applications.

Integration of your R scripts with the ArcGIS platform is even more
effective if you implement them as script tools in an ArcGIS toolbox.
Doing so makes input/output of datasets and numerical/text parameter
values seamless, and enables immediate visualization of feature classes
and tables output by your tools. Your R script tools can be further
integrated into larger processes, for example by incorporating them into
an ArcGIS Model Builder workspace, or importing them to Python scripts
using ArcPy commands to create more advanced geoprocessing workflows.

It is highly recommended that you continue the tutorial series by
completing the *Building R Script Tools* tutorial. This will teach you
how to create toolboxes that integrate your R code with ArcGIS Pro or
ArcGIS Desktop.
