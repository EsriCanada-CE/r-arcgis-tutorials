# Tutorial Overview

R is an open-source statistical computing language that offers a large suite of data analysis and statistical tools, and is currently the de facto standard for statistical data analysis and visualization for academics and other communities. While its various third-party packages introduce a variety of advanced spatial statistical capabilities, it can be a challenge to access many spatial datasets.  The **R-ArcGIS** bridge solves this challenge by providing an `arcgisbinding` package that allows ArcGIS datasets to be read and written easily from the R programming language. This tutorial will introduce you to the use of the R-ArcGIS Bridge in R scripts, and enable you to integrate ArcGIS datasets into your R statistical processes.  It will also give you have the pre-requisite knowledge to create script tools in ArcGIS that execute R functions, which will be covered in the following tutorial in this series.

## Background Information

The R user community has seen substantial growth in recent years, and is expected to continue growing due to the increasing popularity of statistical data analysis. You can use R in conjunction with ArcGIS to develop tools that can broaden the functionality of ArcGIS. Before you can create these tools, you need to develop an understanding of how to work with the `arcgisbinding` package that is installed by the **R-ArcGIS** bridge. Learning how to incorporate ArcGIS datasets into your R scripts to perform data analysis will greatly extend the possibilities that exist for analyzing both spatial and non-spatial data.

R is different from many other programming languages, in that it was developed primarily for data analysis and computational statistics. While the language and environment have evolved over the past two decades to incorporate many other capabilities, this initial focus provides R with almost every statistical model and data manipulation technique that you would need for modern data analysis.  However, it can be a challenge to integrate with other data types or software environments.

The `arcgisbinding` package resolves the challenge of working with ArcGIS datasets by introducing to R a set of functions and classes that facilitate reading, writing, and manipulating ArcGIS datasets in the R programming language. It further enables integration of R with ArcGIS software through the ability to create script tools in ArcGIS toolboxes that execute R code.

By completing this tutorial, you will become familiar with the use of the `arcgisbinding` and the capabilities it introduces to the R environment.  You will learn how to read and write data from ArcGIS datasets, and manipulate and analyze spatial data in the R programming language.

# Part A: Getting Started

To prepare for this workshop, you should have successfully completed the *Getting Started* and *R Scripting Basics* tutorials, which will ensure that you the required software installed and configured, as well as the basic R scripting skills necessary to complete this tutorial. From the *R Scripting Basics* tutorial, should be familiar with the **R** and **RStudio** software, and be able to work with the R Markdown format within the **RStudio** IDE.  In this tutorial, everything discussed can be completed using the default **RGui** installed with **R**. However, this document is available as an R-Markdown file that you can open and use interactively in **RStudio**. If you choose instead to use **RGui** or another IDE, you can copy/paste code snippets into any R console or R script, or otherwise or adapt the code in another IDE environment. 

## Setup

To work with the R Markdown source for this document:

1. Open the *`r-arcgis-rstudio.Rproj`* file in **RStudio**
2. Open the *File* tab in the top-right panel (based on the layout options recommended in the *R Scripting Basics* tutorial), and click on the file named *`3-R-ArcGIS-Scripting.Rmd`*. The R-Markdown source code for this document will open in the *Source* editor window in the top-left.
4. In the top-right corner of the source editor, you may click the ![](images/rstudio-maxpane.jpg) maximize icon to toggle the maximized state of the panel, and use as much screen space as possible to display the document's source code.

***Note:*** The remainder of this document is written with the expectation that you are working with the R Markdown file in **RStudio**. If not, you may manually copy R commands enclosed in the \`\`\`\{r\} code blocks into any R console, provided that your current working directory (reported by `getwd()`) corresponds with the location where the tutorial files are located.

Before proceeding to interactively run code in the rest of the R Markdown document, select *Restart R and Clear Output* from the ![Run](images/rstudio-runmenu.jpg) menu, and then run the following block to configure the R environment to help with the display of outputs in the resulting R Notebook, and to prepare a `data.gdb` file geodatabase from an empty template:

```{r include=FALSE}
# Run this line to disable magic quotes in output...
options(useFancyQuotes = FALSE)

# If a copy of data.gdb exists, delete it...
if (file.exists('data.gdb')) {
  unlink('data.gdb', recursive = TRUE)
}

# Create a new folder named 'data.gdb' and copy the contents of 'empty.gdb' into it:
if (!file.exists('data.gdb')) {
  dir.create('data.gdb')
  invisible(file.copy(paste0('empty.gdb/',list.files('empty.gdb')), 'data.gdb', overwrite = TRUE, recursive = FALSE, copy.mode = TRUE))
}
```
## Load the R-ArcGIS `arcgisbinding` package

In any stand-alone R script, you must load the `arcgisbinding` package in the current R session, and then call `arc.check_product()` before you can use any of the functionality provided by the `arcgisbinding` package.  In the next tutorial, you will learn that this is not required when using an R script configured as a script tool in an ArcGIS Toolbox.  However, it is a step that must always be performed to use `arcgisbinding` methods from an R console or in an R IDE such as **RStudio**. 

To get started using the `arcgisbinding` package in this tutorial, run the block of code below to load the package and bind to your **ArcGIS Pro** or **ArcGIS Desktop** (ArcMap) software in your current R session:

```{r}
library(arcgisbinding)
arc.check_product()
```

*Hint: Remember from the *R Scripting Basics* tutorial that the `helper-functions.R` script included in the tutorial files provides methods that do this for you.  You can try replacing the lines above with the R command to `source()` the helper script, and then use the `load_pkgs()` function. You could also replace any `library()` statements in the remainder of this document with `load_pkgs()`, which would ensure any missing CRAN packages are be installed automatically from the Internet.*

# Part B: Reading data from ArcGIS Datasets

The `arcgisbinding` package provides two methods that enable you to easily read data directly from ArcGIS datasets.  For reading data, you will use `arc.open()` to create dataset objects that essentially serve as a connection to an existing ArcGIS dataset.  With a dataset object, you may then use `arc.select()` to connect to existing datasets and read features/tables into data frames in the R workspace.

## Connecting to an ArcGIS dataset

To use the `arc.open()` method to connect to an existing ArcGIS dataset, you must provide it with a single argument that specifies a path.  The path must point to a standard feature class, feature layer, or table in a format supported by ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop.  These include simple files (e.g., shapefiles, csv, dBASE), geodatabases (file/enterprise), feature dataset components, etc.  In 64-bit/Pro, feature service URLs will also work.

The returned result from the `arc.open()` method is a dataset object, which contains details about the spatial characteristics and attributes contained within the dataset.

***Note:** When specifying paths, be sure to escape backslashes (using double-backslashes), or use forward slashes.  Paths may be absolute paths (starting with a drive letter (e.g., `C:/`), or a network share (`//hostname/share/`)), or they can be relative to the current working directory (that you can get or set the with `getwd()` and `setwd()` commands)*

Start by opening the polygon boundaries for census subdivisions from Statistics Canada for the 2016 Census:

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.open
csd <- arc.open("data/census/census2016.gdb/CensusSubdivisions")
```

You can report a summary of the dataset, or inspect several attributes as object properties (path, dataset_type, extent, fields, and spatialinfo) using the `@` operator:

```{r}
csd
csd@shapeinfo
csd@extent
```

## Reading an ArcGIS dataset into a data frame

To load data from the connection into a data frame in the current R session, use the `arc.select()` method.  This method requires a dataset object created by the `arc.open()` as its first argument.  You may also optionally supply any of the four following as positional or named arguments:

* `fields` - A character vector of one or more fieldnames to select.  Defaults to `'*'` (i.e., to select all fields)
* `where_clause` - An optional string representing an SQL query to filter features read from the dataset.  Defaults to an empty string (i.e., to select all records)
* `selected` - In the context of a script tool, if records are selected in the layer or table from the corresponding ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop session, then only those records will be read into the R session.  Defaults to `TRUE`.
* `sr` - If set to a well-known ID, well-known text, or Proj.4 text representation of a spatial reference, features will be automatically reprojected as they are read into the R session.  Defaults to NULL (i.e., features will be read in their original spatial reference)

Load the CSD boundaries for Canada, and keep only the province name, CSD name, and CSD Identifier attributes:

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.select
csd_df <- arc.select(csd, c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"))
```

The same data could be read with by providing the desired fieldnames as a named argument to the `arc.select()`:

```{r}
csd_df <- arc.select(csd, fields = c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"))
```

***Tip:** using named arguments allows you to execute the function without memorizing the positional order of optional arguments, and/or omit optional that you do not want to define.  Also note the use of the `=` operator for named arguments, versus the `<-` assignment operator.* 

# Part C: Working with ArcGIS datasets in R

Once you have loaded data from an ArcGIS dataset into an R session, you can work with it like any regular data frame.  For example, you may want to load join some additional tabular data and join it to boundaries to enable you to perform spatial analyses using a variety of spatial statistical packages in R.  Do do this, you could load a feature layer that already has data joined to it from an ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop session, or by reading data from feature layer that has a pre-defined join in it.

## Manipulating ArcGIS spatial data frames

It is also possible to join two datasets easily within the R language using functionality provided by the `dplyr` package. In the code block below, income data from the 2016 census aggregated at the census subdivision level are loaded from an ArcGIS file geodatabase table.  An SQL clause is applied to limit features to those with valid global non-response rates below 25%, and the results are joined to the `csd_df` data frame containing the census subdivision boundaries. The forward-pipe operator `%>%` is used to chain the `arc.open()`, `arc.select()` and `right_join()` methods in a single command, with the result assigned to the `csd_income` variable: 

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Load income data for dissemination areas, and join by the csd geo_code the boundary data frame:
csd_income <- arc.open('data/census/census2016.gdb/income2016csd') %>% 
  arc.select(c("geo_code", "gnr", "pop2016_t", "popdens_t", "income_median_t"), where_clause = "gnr is not null and gnr < 25") %>% 
  right_join(csd_df, by = c("geo_code" = "CSDUID"))
class(csd_income)
```

This join operation produces a new data frame that does not include the spatial information from the original `csd_df` data frame.  To attach the joined attributes back to the `csd_df` data frame, we can assign columns directly.  This can be done because the `csd_df` data frame was provided as the 'right' data frame in the `right_join()` method above, so the resulting `csd_income` data frame has the same number and order of rows:

```{r}
# Add columns back to the boundaries data frame:
csd_df$income_median_t <- csd_income$income_median_t
csd_df$pop2016_t <- csd_income$pop2016_t
csd_df$popdens_t <- csd_income$popdens_t
csd_df$gnr <- csd_income$gnr
```

***Note:** This limitation may be addressed in a future version of the R-ArcGIS bridge.  For the time being, this workaround is needed.  Another alternative by converting the ArcGIS spatial data frame to an `sp` data frame, and using the `spdplyr` package is discussed later in this tutorial.*

It can be useful to rank or categorize data.  For example, we can categorize CSDs into quantiles using the `dplyr` `ntile()` method.  There are several other `dplyr` available for ranking data.  Type `?ranking` in the R console to read more - try adding a percentile rank of CSDs by population density, for example:

```{r}
csd_df$income_group <- ntile(csd_df$income_median_t, 5)
```

With a quantile column now added, we can summarize data by groups.  In the code block below, the `csd_df` data frame is filtered to limit operations to rows with a valid `income_group` value, then grouped by `income_group`.  Next, the `summarize_at()` function is used to obtain min/max values of population and median income for each group.  The `mutate()` function created new columns with simpler names for the results of the `summarize_at()` method.  Using the `right_join()` and `select()` methods, these new columns are joined to the `csd_df` data frame, and then isolated from the rest of the columns in the data.  The results are assigned to a `csd_group_ranges` variable.  To attach new columns representing the min/max population and median income of each census boundary's corresponding income group, we can assign columns from the `csd_group_ranges` back to the original `csd_df` data frame:

```{r}
csd_group_ranges <- csd_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(income_group)) %>% 
  group_by(income_group) %>%
  summarize_at(vars(pop2016_t,income_median_t), funs(min(., na.rm = TRUE), max(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  mutate(
    income_min = income_median_t_min,
    income_max = income_median_t_max,
    pop_min = pop2016_t_min,
    pop_max = pop2016_t_max
  ) %>%
  right_join(csd_df) %>% 
  select(income_min, income_max, pop_min, pop_max)

csd_df$income_min = csd_group_ranges$income_min
csd_df$income_max = csd_group_ranges$income_max
csd_df$pop_min = csd_group_ranges$pop_min
csd_df$pop_max = csd_group_ranges$pop_max
```

## Working with spatial data in R

Thus far we have learned how to work with ArcGIS spatial data frames, which can be analyzed and manipulated much like any other data frame objects in R. However, many packages in R that work with spatial data require geospatial features to be represented in other object types.  The `arcgisbinding` package provides several methods that allow you to convert data to/from `sp` types of data objects:

### Manipulation and visualization of spatial data

* `arc.data2sp()` - which easily converts ArcGIS spatial data frames to `sp` data frame objects (either `SpatialPointsDataFrame`, `SpatialLinesDataFrame`, or `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`)
* `arc.sp2data()` - if you are finished performing spatial analysis with your data as `sp` data frame objects, you can use this method to convert to an ArcGIS spatial data frame object.
* `arc.shape2sp()` - if you do not require the attributes associated with your features, this method may be used to convert an ArcGIS spatial data frame to simple `sp` spatial objects (`SpatialLines`, `SpatialPoints`, or `SpatailPolygons`)

By converting your ArcGIS data frame objects to `sp` spatial data frames, you will be able to use variety of existing packages and operations in R designed for working with spatial data.  The `sp` package for example makes it easy to generate map plots using the `spplot()` function.  Spatial data frames can also be manipulated using functions provided by the `spdplyr` package, which exposes many `dplyr`-like verbs.  Numerous other packages that provide geospatial analytical methods will accept or return `sp` data objects as inputs and outputs.

In the block of code below, we can see the `csd_df` data frame with census subdivision boundaries is converted into an `sp` data frame object, that is assigned to the `csd_sp` variable.  Using the `spplot` and the `filter()` function from the `spdplyr` package, we can easily generate a map plots of polygons for subsets of data from the spatial data frame.  In this case, we are displaying the median income levels for census subdivisions in New Brunswick, or British Columbia. 

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.data2sp

csd_sp <- arc.data2sp(csd_df)

library(spdplyr)

# Show the income for CSDs in New Brunwswick::
spplot(filter(csd_sp, grepl("New Brunswick", PRNAME)), "income_median_t")

# Or British Columbia:
spplot(filter(csd_sp, grepl("British Columbia", PRNAME)), "income_median_t")
```

With the `spdplyr` package available for working with `sp` data frame objects, we can to perform additional operations like `left_join()` or `inner_join()` and retain the data frame's spatial properties.  For example, the earlier code block that created the `csd_income` data frame by performing a join with the `csd_df` data frame could rewritten as follows:

```{r}
# Load Saskatchewan boundaries and income data:
sask_df <- arc.select(csd, fields = c("PRNAME", "CSDNAME", "CSDUID"), where_clause = "PRNAME like 'Sask%'")
income_df <- arc.open('data/census/census2016.gdb/income2016csd')  %>% 
        arc.select(c("geo_code", "gnr", "pop2016_t", "popdens_t", "income_median_t"), where_clause = "gnr is not null and gnr < 25")

# Join income data to the saskatchewan boundaries using by using an intermediate sp data frame 
csd_income_spatial <- arc.sp2data(left_join(arc.data2sp(sask_df), income_df, by = c("CSDUID" = "geo_code")))

class(csd_income_spatial)
```

The resulting `csd_income_spatial` data frame created above will have ArcGIS spatial properties, plus the additional columns added directly to it from the joined data frame.  If you inspect it in the *Environment* tab in **RStudio**, you will see its first 7 columns are identical to the `csd_df` that we have been working with so far in this tutorial.

Because of the intermediate translation to/from an `sp` data frame, this may be less efficient when working with larger datasets (e.g., the sample above is limited to Saskatchewan boundaries). If you need to work with your data in `sp` data frames in your analysis, you can use this approach and other verbs supported by `spdplyr` to help simplify your code. You can get full details about the `dplyr` verbs that can be executed with `sp` data frames using the `spdplyr` package by executing `?"dplyr-Spatial"` to display the corresponding help documentation.

### Analyzing spatial data in R

There are many different spatial statistical analysis packages available for R. To get a thorough overview, refer to the Spatial CRAN Task View at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html).  Typically, the spatial analysis functions in each of package will work with specific structures of data, or specific data object types, such as `sp` data frames. 

As an example, using the income data available for census subdivisions, we can calculate income inequality statistics using functions provided by the `ineq` package.  In the code block below, we can generate a Lorenz curve and calculate the Gini coefficient for census subdivisions within Ontario to measure inequality of median income across the province.

***Note:** the `plot()` and `text()` command must be executed at the same time to work properly. When running these functions within the R-Markdown document in **RStudio**, either highlight all of the lines from the `plot()` command to the `text()` command and press ***CTRL+Enter***, or run the entire block at once by pressing the ![Run Chunk](images/rstudio-runchunk.jpg) button*

```{r eval=c(-8,-13)}
# Load the ineq package:
library(ineq)

# Filter out N/A values for income, and limit to Ontario CSDs:
on_spdata <- csd_sp %>% filter(!is.na(income_median_t), grepl("Ontario", PRNAME))

# Calculate the lorenz curve:
?Lc
lc <- Lc(on_spdata$income_median_t)
plot(lc)

# Calculate the Gini coefficient, and add it to the plot:
?Gini
g <- Gini(on_spdata$income_median_t)
text(0.2,0.9,paste(c("Gini: ", as.character(g)), collapse=""))
```

***Note:** this analysis is for illustrative purposes only - income indicators aggregated at census subdivision levels will not reveal much of the inequality that occurs within the census subdivisions themselves*

Since we have we have census subdivision boundaries associated with our data, we can look at spatial properties of the Gini coefficient using the `spGini()` method from the `lctools` package.  The `spGini()` function allows us to discern how much of the Gini coefficient we observed for median income at the census subdivision level can be attributed to a inequality among local neighbours (`gwGini` in the output) vs non-spatial neighbours (`nsGini`).  In this case, the `spGini()` function requires simple coordinates represented as a matrix.  We can obtain the this from the centroid points of each census subdivision using the `sp` package's `coordinates()` function.

```{r eval=c(-3,-4)}
library(lctools)

?spGini
?coordinates

# the spGini method relies on simple x/y coordinates:
coords = coordinates(on_spdata)
spG <- spGini(coords, 15, on_spdata$income_median_t)
spG
```

The results of the `spGini()` analysis in this example will show that the majority of the Gini coefficient for the province of Ontario at the census subdivision level does not come from inequality between neighbouring locations (with 97.5% of the global Gini coming from inequality between non-spatially coincident census subdivisions).  The significance of these results can be tested by running a monte-carlo simulation series using the `mc.spGini()` function (***Note:** this test may take a few minutes to execute*):

```{r eval=-1}
?mc.spGini

# Run a monte-carlo simulation to test significance:
spG.sim20 <- mc.spGini(Nsim=19, 15, on_spdata$income_median_t, coords[,1], coords[,2])
spG.sim20$pseudo.p
```

By running 19 (or more) simulations, it can be argued that the observed results from `spGini()` are significant by obtaining pseudo p-value of 0.05 or lower (i.e., suggesting that the probability that the observed result is due to chance is 5% or less).

# Part D: Writing data from R to ArcGIS datasets

At this point, we have shown that ArcGIS datasets can be read easily into an R session, and demonstrated how you can manipulate spatial data frames, visualize the spatial data in map plots, and use the spatial data objects in spatial analyses.  However, the **R-ArcGIS** bridge works in both directions, enabling you to further analyze, visualize, and collaborate by connecting the outputs of your R programs to the ArcGIS platform.

The simplest approach for this that the `arcgisbinding` package provides is to write your data to ArcGIS datasets using the `arc.write()` method.  With this function, you can write spatial and tabular data frames to conventional ArcGIS dataset formats. The `arc.write()` method requires at least two arguments:

* `path`: the full or relative path to an ArcGIS dataset that will be created (\*.shp, \*.csv, \*.dbf, \*.gdb featureclass/table, etc)
* `data`: the data frame to be written (ArcGIS or `sp` spatial data frame, or simple tabular data frame).  This must be an ArcGIS spatial data frame, an `sp` data frame, or a simple tabular data frame.

Optional arguments include:

* `coords`: list containing geometry information (e.g., to add spatial properties to tabular data)
* `shape_info`: a list object containing geometry type and spatial reference information

In the code block below, you can see the Ontario census subdivision data we analyzed being converted to an ArcGIS data frame object using the `arc.sp2data()` function, assigned to the `on_dfdata` variable name.  This is then written as a new feature class in an a sample `data.gdb` file geodatabase: 

```{r eval=-1}
?arc.write

on_dfdata <- arc.sp2data(on_spdata)

arc.write('data.gdb/ontario_data', on_dfdata, shape_info=list(type="Polygon", WKT=csd@shapeinfo$WKT))
```

## Choosing an output path for `arc.write()`:

When you specify the output path to use with `arc.write()`, ensure that you appropriately define a new path for a shapefile inside a regular folder, or to a new featureclass inside of an ArcGIS geodatabase.  These paths may be relative, or absolute file locations (as with the `arc.open()` command), for example:

* `arc.write('data.gdb/ontario_data', on_dfdata)` - creates a new feature class in an existing `data.gdb` file geodatabase
* `arc.write('data.sde/ontario_data', on_dfdata)` - creates a new feature class in an existing enterprise geodatabse, identified by the `data.sde` connection file
* `arc.write('data/ontario_data.shp' on_dfdata)` - creates a new shapefile in the `data` folder location

If you want to save tabular data, specify path to a new table name in a geodatabase, or an appropriate tabular file format in a folder. If the dataset you are saving is in an ArcGIS spatial data frame, and you only want to save the tabular data, you can wrap the variable in the `data.frame()` function to discard the spatial information.  For example:

* `arc.write('data.gdb/ontario_data_tbl', data.frame(on_dfdata))` - creates a new table in an existing `data.gdb` file geodatabase
* `arc.write('data/ontario_data_tbl.dbf', data.frame(on_dfdata)` - creates a new table in dBASE format in the `data` folder
* `arc.write('data/ontario_data_tbl.csv' data.frame(on_dfdata))` - creates a new table in comma-separated variable text format in the `data` folder

***Note:** fieldnames in feature classes and tables will be truncated when written to shapefile or dBASE formats.  When written to geodatabases, invalid characters in fieldnames will be converted to underscores, and fieldnames may otherwise be converted to upper or lowercase depending on the underlying database system.* 

It is important also to be aware that the `arc.write()` method from the `arcgisbinding` package does not currently support overwriting existing datasets.  For example, if you run the sample code block above twice, it will report an error the second time because the `ontario_data` feature class already exists in the output `data.gdb` file geodatabase. You can handle this when running standalone R scripts in one of two ways:

* Use a unique output path/filename each time you use `arc.write()` (e.g., by using the `tempfile()` method in the R base)
* Delete any output dataset at a given path before using the same path with `arc.write()`.  With this approach, you can use the base R file manipulation functions (see `?files` for details) to delete simple file/folder paths.  However, for ArcGIS geodatabases (either file or enterprise), ArcGIS software (or perhaps a Python script using ArcPy commands) must be used to delete or move datasets.

When an R script is run as a script tool in an ArcGIS Toolbox, overwriting output files is less of a concern when the paths are defined using output parameters. In this context, the ArcGIS geoprocessing environment will either prevent overwriting existing datasets, or cleanly remove them before executing the script tool (based on whether the geoprocessing option to allow tools to overwrite outputs is enabled).

## Defining the `spatial_info` parameter

You will typically only need to supply two parameters in the list object supplied in the `shape_info` parameter for the `arc.write()` function:

* `type` - the geometry type, either `"Point"`, `"Polyine"`, `"Polygon"`
* `WKT` - the Well-known text representation of the dataset's spatial reference system

If you are writing data that have the same shape type and projection as an ArcGIS dataset object created by the `arc.open()` command, then you can pass the `@shapeinfo` property of the dataset object directly as the `shape_info` parameter for the `arc.write()` command.  In the earlier codeblock, the data that were written to the `data.gdb/ontario_data` feature class have the same geometry type and same spatial reference system as the `csd` data object. Thus the `arc.write()` command would achieve the same by supplying `csd@shapeinfo` as the value for the `shape_info` argument instead of defining a new `list()` object.

## Working with spatial reference definitions:

In some cases, depending on your specific data source and/or the process through which your data are created, you may need to use different representations of spatial reference systems.  The `arcgisbinding` package provides two convenience methods for converting between Well-known ID / Well-known Text and Proj.4 spatial reference systems definitions:

* `arc.fromWktToP4()` - converts a Well-known ID or Well-known Text spatial reference to Proj.4 text
* `arc.fromP4ToWkt()` - converts a Proj.4 spatial reference text string to Well-known text format.  You may use '+init=epsg:<id>' (in ArcGIS Pro only) to convert spatial references from EPSG identifiers to WKT.

***Note:** these functions are fully-functional only when executed in ArcGIS Pro as a script tool.  You can experiment with them more in the context of a script tool executed from ArcGIS Pro, after completing the next tutorial.*

# Exercise 1

At this point, you are now able to read, manipulate, analyze, visualize, and write ArcGIS datasets in the R programming language using the `arcgisbinding` package installed by the **R-ArcGIS** bridge. To test your skills, try the following:

* Read the 'data/toronto/neighbourhoods_crime.shp' shapefile into a new spatial data frame
* Load the 'data/toronto/wb_civics_2011.csv' table into a new data frame, and join its columns to the neighbourhoods_crime data frame. *Hint: one of these stores its identifier as a character vector*
* Add a column with quantile ranks, group/summarize some of the data, create some box plots.
* Write the data with the columns added from the wb_civics_2011.csv data back to a new shapefile. *Hint: remember the result of a join using dplyr with an ArcGIS spatial data frame does not return shape data – copy columns back to the original data frame created by the arc.select() command, or use an intermediate `sp` data frame.*
* Add the new shapefile to your map in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap, and style it by the quantile ranks you added.


# Future Considerations

The `arcgisbinding` package provided by the **R-ArcGIS** bridge is an effective tool to integrate ArcGIS datasets efficiently into your R programs.  It also allows you to generate new ArcGIS datasets as outputs from your R programs to make results from your analyses easily viewed and processed in ArcGIS applications.  This is a significant advantage for developing R programs that need to work with spatial datasets that are easily managed by ArcGIS applications.

Integration of your R scripts with the ArcGIS platform is even more effective if you implement them as script tools in an ArcGIS toolbox.  Doing so makes input/output of datasets and numerical/text parameter values seamless, and enables immediate visualization of feature classes and tables output by your tools.  Your R script tools can be further integrated into larger processes, for example by incorporating them into an ArcGIS Model Builder workspace to create more advanced geoprocessing workflows.

It is highly recommended that you continue the tutorial series by completing the *Building R Script Tools* tutorial. This will teach you how to create toolboxes that integrate your R code with ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Desktop.
